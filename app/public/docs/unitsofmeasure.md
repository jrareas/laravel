# Authorization
This Api is protect by authorization layer. If you are accessing through RapidApi, you dont need to worry about this as RapidApi will provide the necessary authorization.

To make a request to the API you will need to be a registered customer. The registration is a work in progress and access through RapidAPI is the only available so far.

## Authorization Endpoint
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://theapitoolbox.com/oauth/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"grant_type" : "client_credentials",
    "client_id" : "<client_id>",
    "client_secret" : "<client_secret>"
}'
```

# Example Request

```$xslt
curl --location --request GET 'https://theapitoolbox.com/api/unitsofmeasure/mass?unitFrom=lbs&unitTo=kg&value=6' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

In this example, a call to the API to convert 6 `lbs` to `kg`

- URI -  `api/unitsofmeasure{physical_quantity}`
- unitFrom - The unit you are making the convertion from
- unitTo - The unit you are making the convertion to
- value - the value you want to be converted

# Example Response

```$xslt
{
    "data": 2.7215542200000002
}
```
